        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <div>
            Thanks for checking out my site. Although there's a bit of construction going on right
            now (ðŸš§) you can still find some of the front-end utilities I've built below.
            <br /><br />Hopefully I'll continue to find interesting stuff to host here in my corner
            of the Internet. Until then - I hope you find these tools useful!
        </div>
