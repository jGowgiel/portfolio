### We'll be headed to Italy in one week!

My wife Ariel and I will be visiting Italy for 18 days during my Sabbatical from working at Lucid Software. Many of the folks reading along here will be friends and family - hello to all of you! In the tradition of Ariel's semester abroad, we're hoping to keep everyone up to speed with some posts throughout the trip, mostly in text form here and in photo-form with a shared Apple Photos album.
